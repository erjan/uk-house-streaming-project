# uk-house-streaming-project

based on the tutorial https://arbenkqiku.github.io/create-end-to-end-kafka-streaming-pipeline


This is my replication of the pipeline from above, I used ec2 vs gcp and upstash vs confluent to make it more challenging.

tech stack: dbt, docker, bigquery, ec2, kafka , python, mage
